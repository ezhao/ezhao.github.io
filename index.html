          The Chicago native got her B.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (VI-2) from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. After college, she joined Dropbox to work on business operations and product management alongside some super smart and scrappy people. At Dropbox, she worked on internationalization, sales operations, growth, the photos tab and the Mailbox app. At some point, she wanted to learn more about mobile and built some apps in her free time. Shortly after, she met the talented team at Airbnb and joined as an Android engineer.
